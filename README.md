# Real-Estate-Prediction
Real estate is a highly fluctuating market. Though the costs are related to few characteristics, the exact relationship is difficult to guess. This dataset gives us a chance to look into the data on what really influences the value of a house. Linear Regression and Random Forest models are built on the dataset. In the EDA, it was found there are no outliers. After cross validation, the linear regression model was built. It was found the model was free from multicollinearity and autocorrelation. The prediction was done on testing set and RMSE were calculated. The training and testing RMSE were found nearby. The Random Forest model showed a better RMSE result and hence, is a better model to this problem.
